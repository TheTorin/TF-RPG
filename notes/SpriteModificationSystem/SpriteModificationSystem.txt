Current plan:

a) All sprites and animations are split into their component limbs
	i.e There is a werewolf left arm sprite. This sprite has every animation that will be used, 
	but only for the left arm.
	
b) All chars start as the default sprite
	This is just an amalgamation of each chars unique limbs in each frame.
	
c) As transformations take place, we replace the relevant limbs/body/head
	We do this in the following manner:
	
	1) Find each limb that the char has i.e human head, chest, e.t.c with werewolf left arm.
			This will be stored in scr_partyData for easy access
			
	2) Looping through each animation that the char uses (idle, attack):
			We reference each limbs animation of that (i.e HumanHeadIdle, WerewolfLAttack)
			We create a surface to draw on
			We then loop through each frame of each animation, drawing the limbs onto this surface
			Once the animation has been fully drawn, we have the character use those animations instead
				by switching the references in scr_partyData
	
	3) We overwrite the char animations by saving them as well.
		Reminder to sprite_delete() the old sprites before replacing them!
		

(Reference code from sprite_save which looks like good template code to repurpose:)
